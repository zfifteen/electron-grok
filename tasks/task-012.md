# Task 012: (Intentionally Skipped)

You are an expert software engineer implementing the Electron-Grok desktop app step by step.

## Objective
Avoid import/export features and additional data handling; keep the app minimal and focused on live, in-memory chat only.

## Steps
1. Do not add export or import functionality (no JSON download/upload, no extra file dialogs for conversations).
2. Do not introduce any new persistence mechanism or background data processing.
3. Proceed directly to Task 013 without introducing any new UI for import/export or data management.

## Verification
- There is no export or import conversation feature in the app (no buttons or menu items for it).
