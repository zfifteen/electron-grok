# Task 015: Packaging and Distribution

You are an expert software engineer implementing the Electron-Grok desktop app step by step.
Follow the coding style constraints described in Task 001.

## Objective
Prepare the minimal Electron-Grok application for distribution.

## Steps
1. Set up `electron-builder` configuration for the target platform(s) using the minimal set of options required.
2. Build distributables for the current platform.
3. Install and launch the built application to confirm it starts correctly and the basic chat flow works.
4. Update `README.md` with any necessary setup or build instructions discovered during packaging.

## Verification
- Build succeeds and produces working binaries for the current platform.
- The packaged app launches and supports the same minimal chat flow as the development build.
