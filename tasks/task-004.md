# Task 004: IPC Bridge Establishment\n\nYou are an expert software engineer implementing the Electron-Grok desktop app step by step. This is Task 004 of 18.\n\n## Objective\nSet up Electron IPC for communication between main and renderer.\n\n## Steps\n1. In src/main/, create preload.js to expose safe IPC channels (e.g., 'send-to-python', 'python-response').\n2. In main.js, require preload and load it in BrowserWindow webPreferences.\n3. In renderer (preload context), use contextBridge to expose ipcRenderer methods.\n4. Test IPC: Send a 'ping' from renderer, handle in main and reply.\n\n## Verification\n- Console log in renderer shows ping response.\n\nAfter completing this task, read and execute the next: tasks/task-005.md\n\n---\n*Electron-Grok Implementation Chain - Task 004/018*
