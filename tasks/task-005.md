# Task 005: Integrate Python with IPC\n\nYou are an expert software engineer implementing the Electron-Grok desktop app step by step. This is Task 005 of 18.\n\n## Objective\nConnect Python backend to Electron via IPC (using child_process).\n\n## Steps\n1. In main.js, use { spawn } from child_process to start Python backend.py.\n2. Handle IPC 'send-to-python': Write message to Python stdin, read stdout for response.\n3. In Python, read from stdin, process with Grok, write response to stdout.\n4. IPC 'python-response' to send back to renderer.\n5. Handle process lifecycle (spawn on app ready, kill on close).\n\n## Verification\n- Send message from renderer; gets Grok response.\n\nAfter completing this task, read and execute the next: tasks/task-006.md\n\n---\n*Electron-Grok Implementation Chain - Task 005/018*
