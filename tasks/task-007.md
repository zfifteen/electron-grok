# Task 007: Modern Chat Interface Design

You are an expert software engineer implementing the Electron-Grok desktop app step by step.
Follow the coding style constraints described in Task 001.

## Objective
Polish the chat UI with modern styling.

## Steps
1. Install Tailwind CSS in the renderer for styling.
2. Style message bubbles: user messages right-aligned with a blue background, AI messages left-aligned with a neutral gray background.
3. Add scrolling to the message container and auto-scroll to the bottom when new messages arrive.
4. Implement a loading indicator during API calls so the user knows when Grok is responding.
5. Ensure the layout is responsive for different window sizes.

## Verification
- The chat UI looks clean and modern and scrolls properly as messages are added.
